#### WASTELAND SURVIVORS
- A group project for [AVImmerse](https://www.avimmerse.com/) at [Skills City](https://www.skills-city.com/).
- I worked in a group to develop a survival game that would be placed into a contest to potentially have it published on Steam.
Unfortunately we did not win but our game is published on [Itch.IO](https://aletdownofstate.itch.io/wasteland-survivors-rebuilding-hope) and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aletdownofstate/WastelandSurvivorsGE3).
- Our group consisted of 4 people, each with a role to play in the development of the game, we picked a group leader and started getting to work on out project.
##### WHAT DID I DO?
- I contributed to the UI for the game by implementing it into the game using Unity's UI system.
- I also prototyped a layout for the basis of the UI for the game which included where each scene connected and what would be displayed.
