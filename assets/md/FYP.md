#### FYP - FINAL YEAR PROJECT
- My Final Year Project was a demo of 2 different UI types, these were diegetic and non-diegetic UI, my project was to see which of the UI types players found more immersive or if they felt they were the same.
- A requirement for this FYP was to write a 10k - 15k word dissertation and present my finding to my assessor and mentor.
- This is a small segment of my conclusion.
> "In conclusion, we found that participants tend to prefer traditional UI methods like non-diegetic UI when it comes to overall gameplay of first person shooter while they would also say that using diegetic UI methods does create a more immersive experience as the data showed, if a developer was to create a game that needed to be as immersive for the player as possible, they may want to consider using non-traditional UI methods like using in game objects that the character of that game can interact with as a way to display information.
