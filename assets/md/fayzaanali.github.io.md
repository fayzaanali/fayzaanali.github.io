#### MY PERSONAL WEBSITE - FAYZAANALI.GITHUB.IO
- This is my personal website project, I wanted to create a site that would clearly show my projects to anyone who wanted to have a look. 
- I originally only had the website display my [GitHub](https://github.com/fayzaanali/) projects, it does this by using GitHubs API and parsing the code to display it as cards on my website, I have now implemented the ability to add my own projects that may not be on my GitHub, which allows me to add project I have contributed in. 
- This website can now parse Markdown files (.md) using [MarkedJS](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) without it I would not be able to easily write descriptions for my projects.
- I used [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/) as a base css library when I created this website and have over the years added my own CSS on-top to add my own style.
- This website is my longest project on my GitHub and will continue to be something I update throughout the years.
- You can view the source code for this website on my [GitHub](https://github.com/fayzaanali/fayzaanali.github.io).
